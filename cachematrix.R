## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a special vector, which is really a list containing a function to:
## 1. Set the value of the vector
## 2. get the value of the vector
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The cacheSolve function calculates the inverse of the vector created with the above function.
## It first check to see if the inverse has already been calculaed. If yes, it gets the niverse
## from the cache and skips the compupation. If not, it calculates the inverse of the data and
## sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)){
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
